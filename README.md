# Welcome to my Solutions to Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp

Hello visitor! I am [Breno D. Chrispim](https://github.com/DChrispim) and this repository is dedicated to my solutions of the proposed code problems and milestone projects of the course [Complete Python 3 Bootcamp Course - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/?couponCode=COMPLETE_GITHUB) (the repository is [Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp)).

## Proposed problems and Milestone projects

Although this repository aims to provide solutions to all problems in the course [Complete Python 3 Bootcamp Course - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/?couponCode=COMPLETE_GITHUB), some proposed problems/milestone projects are complex/extensive, and therefore they have been moved to their own repositories. Another point is that I took the liberty to generalize them to make them more robust, and I have also written tests (using the unittest package). The solutions are structured using Jupyter notebooks, but to keep them organized, I used the magic commands <code>%%writefile</code> to write Python files in the folder programs and then called the program inside the notebook using either <code>! python</code> or <code>%run</code>.

## About me

I chose to study physics to understand the natural world, and I am passionate about the challenges of learning it. Beyond a deep understanding of Physics, my academic experience has taught me to have a methodical approach to problems and to work in collaborative research, improving not only my communication skills, but also my ability to organize projects.

After finishing my PhD, I continued my journey by growing my knowledge of machine learning and programming with Python. My main goal is to use all my academic background in the industry, migrating from theoretical to practical research, and see the results of my work applied in real-world scenarios.
